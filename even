Write a program, which will find all such numbers between the user-given range (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.

The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Input Format:
The first input consists of an integer type to get starting value.
The second input consists of an integer type to get the ending value.

Output Format:
The output consists of all even digit numbers from the given range separated by a comma. If the range is out of bound, print "Invalid Input".


import java.util.*;
class even
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        int s=0;
        if(1<=a&&b<=5000)
        {
            for(int i=a;i<b-1;i++)
            {
                int r=i/10;
                if(i%2==0&&r%2==0)
                {
                    System.out.print(i);
                    System.out.print(",");
                }
            }
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("Invalid Input");
        }
    }
}
